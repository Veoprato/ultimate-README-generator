# Ultimate README Generator
[![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
## Description
  A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md based off user input. The user will be prompted with a series of questions to help generate the README.md file afterwards. The README will display a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. A badge for the selected license will also be generated with the README which will also redirect to the license's webpage. The user is also given the option to add a table of contents if they'd like.
